# Distributed Password Cracker
Designed a compiler for a subset of C grammar with flexc++ and bisonc++ to generate MIPS assembly code. Used a dead code elimination algorithm to optimize the intermediate code. This was done as part of the Implementation of Programming Languages (CS 302 & CS 316) course at IIT Bombay in Spring 2017.
